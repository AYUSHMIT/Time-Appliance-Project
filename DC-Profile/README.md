# Data Center IEEE1588 PTP Profile 

(DC-PTP Profile)



## Introduction

Note: This document is work-in-progress and the DC-PTP Profile will evolve based on discussions and decisions with the extended team. 

The intent of this document is to define a new PTP (Precision Timing Protocol) profile, entitled *DC-PTP Profile*, for the purpose of distributing accurate and precise time within a data center infrastructure. Currently, the telecom (ITU-T), power (IEC), automotive (AVNU) and video (SMPTE) industries have each defined their own PTP profile.  To date, there is no PTP profile defined for Data Center. The proposal could eventually be submitted as a contribution to OCP and if the technology is demonstrated to be viable.

This document defines the PTP profile for time synchronization in a data center environment, providing time alignment across a set network elements, from a primary reference time clock to a large set of servers.
