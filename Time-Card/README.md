Time Card is the heart of the Open Grandmaster Project. 
You can find more info on <www.ocptap.com>

## Inspiration

Grandmaster is a critical part of a PTP enabled network. It provides accurate time via GNSS while maintains the accuracy in case of GNSS failure via a high stability (and holdover) oscillator such as an atomic clock. Exisiting products in the market are often closed sourced an far from sufficient features. The Time Card project presents an open source solution via a PCIe card.

## Architecure of Open Grandmaster

The open grandmaster project envisions the following system diagram:

The initial design of the Time card was the following napkin sketch:

## What you will find in this repository

* Bill of Materials (parts from Digikey)
* Schematic and PCB of the timing card
* Driver (Kernel Module) CentOS 8
* CAD files for the custom PCIe bracket 

## Where can I get one?

You have all necessary source code, BOM, Gerber files and binaries to build it youself. However, we are currently working with several suppliers and will have their contact info soon available to allow you to puchase an out-of-the-box ready Time Card.
