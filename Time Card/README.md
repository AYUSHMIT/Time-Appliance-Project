## Inspiration

Grandmaster is a critial part of a PTP enabled network. It provides accurate time via GNSS while maintains the accuracy in case of GNSS failure via a high stability (and holdover) oscillator such as an atomic clock. Exisiting products in the market are often closed sourced an far from sufficient features. The Time Card project presents an open source solution via a PCIe card.
